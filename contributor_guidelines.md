## How to Make a Contribution

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a feature branch for your contribution. If the contribution addresses a specific Github issue, please **prefix your branch name with the issue number**. For example, “2-fix-typo-in-settings-page”.
3. Make code changes on your feature branch.
4. Test your changes. At this time, the repo does not possess any automated tests, so it is your responsibility to do a **thorough manual test** of your changes and any areas that may be affected.
5. Push your changes to the remote feature branch on your fork.
6. Open a pull request from your feature branch into the main repo’s **dev** branch. **You MUST include the PR Checklist in the description (see below)**. Request review from code owners (@MarquisLP and @aunwarkraft), and then submit.
7. We will review your pull request as soon as we are able. If approved, we will merge your branch. If rejected, push changes that address our comments, and then we will re-review.



## PR Checklist

When you open a PR targeting this repo on Github, the description will automatically be filled in with [this checklist](../pull_request_template.md).

We recommend opening the PR before you start making any changes, and set it as a Draft PR. Then, while you work on and test your changes, tick off the items in the checklist. Once all relevant items have been ticked, you can then mark your PR as Ready for Review.

**We will only review PRs that have all applicable items ticked off.**
